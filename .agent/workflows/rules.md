description: Activate all 15 Aoneko rules permanently — unified Antigravity quality standard
---

# /rules — Permanent Rules Activation

This workflow loads the complete Antigravity quality standard from all 15 rules.

## Steps

// turbo-all

1. Read the unified rules manifest:
   ```
   View file: .agent/RULES_MANIFEST.md
   ```
   6 operational layers: Foundation (1,2,12), Logic (4,9), Experience (3,8), Quality (5,6,11), Frontier (10), Antigravity (14,15).

2. Internalize ALL principles. Foundation + Antigravity layers are ALWAYS active.

3. Apply rules proactively based on task context.

## Notes
- Rules 4≡7 and 8≡13 are duplicates, consolidated in the manifest.
- `.agent/RULES_MANIFEST.md` is the single source of truth.
